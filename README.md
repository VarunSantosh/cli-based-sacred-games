# Welcome to my simple RPG Game

* It's called SACRED GAMES.
* The game is not that tough and you can win it with luck or with your smartness.
* Tools used to build this app is MacOS, IntelliJ. If possible i=use them for better experience.

## Goal
The goal was to write a command line based role playing game.

## General comments
* I didn't really have much time to do this, so there are still many things to be improved.
* Test coverage is not sufficient, but since major part of the application is printing in console didn't get time to write test cases using Spock.
